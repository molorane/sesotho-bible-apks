Magento enables you to build EE from these cloned repositories in any of the following ways:

- Copy contents of the `magento2ee` repository to the `magento2ce`, replacing all duplicated files. Although this way is simpler, it doesn't allow you to updated code from the upstream repositories in the future.

- Use the `dev/tools/build-ee.php` script from the `magento2ee` repository. It creates *symlinks* to *EE code* in  the`magento2ee` repository.
